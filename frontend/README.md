# Development

To set up the environment for development, add a WASM target (note, this assumes you have Rust installed via rustup):

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

To be able to build, run and test the application, you will need the trunk command as well:

```bash
cargo install trunk
```
